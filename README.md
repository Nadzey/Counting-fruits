# Counting-fruits
Here's a simple application that allows a user to request a file (basket) and returns the results of those requests in a file called "results.csv."
## Framework Description: Cypress + JavaScript + Mocha + Chai E2E Testing for Counting fruits project

### Overview
The `Cypress` framework, along with `JavaScript`, `Mocha`, and `Chai`, provides a robust end-to-end (E2E) testing solution specifically tailored for the Counting fruits project. 

**How to start working in our project?**

1. Clone repository to your machine.

2. Navigate to project root folder.

3. Run command ```npm ci``` in code editor node.js terminal (VScode for example).
   
4. Create new branch.

5. After, execute ```npx cypress open```  to run tests.
   
6. For running tests with reports use ```npx cypress run --headed --browser chrome```
   
8. The results.cvs file will created

**Project Coding Convention**

Naming conventions:
We shall use Camelcase for naming conventions: ```camelCase```

**Spec structure:**

- Each block ```describe``` should contain name of group
- Each test (```it```) should contain name of test case (```AT```) 
example:

describe('Counting fruits data from csv file', () => {

    it('AT_001.001 | should return result in csv file', function () {
        ...
    })
})

**Attention!**

1. Not allowed to install any libraries, plugins, etc. to avoid changing configuration files.
2. The cypress.env.json is created automatically when the ci/cd is started

**!!Do not push changed files as:**

```package.json```
```package.lock.json```
```ci.yml```
```cancel.yml```
```cypress.config.js```
```e2e.js```
```cypress.env.json```

### Key Features
- **End-to-End Testing**: The framework enables comprehensive testing of the Counting fruits ptoject, covering the entire application flow from order creation to delivery tracking.
- **Automation**: Cypress and JavaScript provide powerful automation capabilities, allowing businesses to automate repetitive tasks such as order placement, form filling, status updates, and delivery details verification.
- **Mocha Test Framework**: Mocha provides a flexible and powerful test framework, enabling businesses to write clear and structured tests in a style that suits their preferences, whether it's BDD or TDD.
- **Chai Assertion Library**: Chai offers a wide range of assertion styles and expressive syntax, empowering businesses to write concise and readable assertions to validate the expected behavior of the courier service.
- **Fast and Reliable Testing**: Cypress offers fast and reliable test execution with real-time reloading, automatic waiting for network requests, and built-in debugging capabilities, ensuring efficient testing of the Peshkariki courier service.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Cypress supports running tests across multiple browsers, allowing businesses to verify the compatibility and consistent behavior of the courier service on different platforms.
